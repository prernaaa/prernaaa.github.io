        <!-- SECTION 1 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Introduction</small>

            <h2>A little about the project</h2>

            <p>While Bopdrop is a unique app and its basic layout and functionality work, there was room for improvement
                that I and other users saw. The point of the app is to share music and connect with others through doing
                so. The visual language and parts of the functionality, however, do not showcase that to the full
                possible extent.</p>

            <p>My primary goal with this redesign was to clean up the interface to place more emphasis on the music
                sharing aspect. Though not fully possible with a mockup, I also wanted to allow for more formats of
                music to be shared, beyond just songs.</p>

            <p><b>Side note:</b> My work is just for my own creative exploration and not at all a suggestion to abandon
                their existing interface! I don't work for them, so I obviously don't have an exhaustive understanding
                of their decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Problem space exploration</small>

            <h2>What are users saying?</h2>

            <p>I conducted a survey with five users. Users primarily used the app to connect with others and to share
                and discover new music. The posting and following/explore pages were most used; currently, posts are
                limited to songs, and do not allow for sharing playlists or albums, and as a music sharing app, that
                functionality would greatly improve the app experience. The least used feature mentioned was the
                discover section and messaging, but even so, the latter is required to pass through to get to
                notifications and the former takes up a prominent spot in the footer.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Ideation and Process</small>

            <h2>How might we address these challenges?</h2>

            <p>I wanted to clean up the layout, but didn't want to make it needlessly minimal or somehow make it less
                effective in the process. Ultimately, I decided on a few key goals: adding the aforementioned
                functionalities, decluttering other parts of the app to make it easier to navigate, and drawing the
                focus to features that are used most (the home and share tabs, and the profile tab). I also wanted to
                make some amendments within those sections by making some parts of the post smaller and turning the
                navigaiton into overlays instead of having a footer like it does now.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>

            <img src="images/bdre/bdw.png" alt="Wireframes for the redesign">
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 4 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Prototyping and Iterating</small>

            <h2>Developing the protoype</h2>

            <p>After gathering some feedback on the wireframes and IA, I created higher-fidelity screens. The majority
                of my work was essentially just organising the information architecture and making it more intuitive. I
                divided the footer into a notifications tab and a new post icon, since users used those more than other
                features. I also divided each page of the app into its own menu button to make them more directly
                accessible. Finally, I cleaned up the messaging layout and alluded to the option of sharing albums and
                playlists, which most users pointed to as a potential improvement.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Retrospective</small>

            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

            <p>✽ This was my first attempt at redesigning an application, and a challenge for me to see through a
                personal project. I learned a lot throughout this task–both about Figma and UX processes, as well as
                about my own creativity.</p>

            <h2>What's next?</h2>

            <p>✽ My research methods could have been more thorough; to make up for that and identify its success and
                potential usability issues, I think evaluating my design with current Bopdrop users and iterating it
                based on those results would be a beneficial (and necessary) next step.</p>
