        <!-- SECTION 1 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Overview</small>

            <h2>How did North Chicago Pilates come to be?</h2>

            <p>Over the course of three months, my team–of myself and three others–developed this project for HCI 440 at
                DePaul, with the aim of creating an integrated experience that bridges digital and real-world
                experiences.</p>

            <p>We noticed that class registration can be difficult; registering for studios and classes can require too
                much time spent at the front desk of a gym, and searching for classes can be equally time-consuming.
                There is also a lack of pricing and payment transparency, and clarity about class times and what to
                bring to a class.</p>

            <h3>Our goal is to help users feel empowered, excited, and in control of their personal fitness experience,
                and create a transparent and trustworthy class purchasing experience.</h3>

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Understanding the User: Personas</small>

            <h2>Who are we building for?</h2>

            <p>We conducted a total of eight contextual inquiries and created the following personas by consolidating
                what we learned:</p>
            <p><b>Meet Jill</b>, a 24-year-old graduate student who is interested in signing up for a class at North
                Chicago Pilates after hearing her best friend rave about how transformative the classes were for
                strength and posture. Despite trusting her friend, Jill has always been a cautious person who always
                does her research before committing to anything. She believes strongly in trying things out before
                committing as she is careful with her money as she is still a student. As she is a student, finding a
                class time that works with her class schedules and extracurriculars is also important to her.</p>

            <p><b>Meet Luca</b>, a 31-year-old grammar school teacher and regular Pilates student at the North Chicago
                Pilates Studio. Luca has been practicing Pilates at the studio for the past year, and now he is seeking
                to challenge himself more with a more intense Pilates class. He doesn’t want to rush and pick a class
                too advanced for himself, so during his breaks at work, Luca browses through the “recommended for you”
                classes on the application to view the descriptions, instructor ratings, and schedules for different
                classes. When a class sparks his interests, he saves them to his “favorites” to review at a later time.

            <h2>What will our users need?</h2>

            <p>From these interviews, we also created a concept analysis table, as shown below. Additionally, we created
                a list of functional, social, quality, and data requirements.</p>

            <small>Prototyping and Testing</small>

            <h2>Time to create and refine our product!</h2>

            <p>After creating our first prototype, we conducted eight user tests for two specific user flows: new users
                and returning users. We had new users sign up for a new account and input preferences and get
                recommendations for their first class, while returning users signed up for a class using credits through
                the class favorites page. Our key findings were the following:</p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>The <b>sign in needed to be more visible</b>, since many users assumed that the text fields were for
                    signing
                    up, not signing in.</li>
                <li>The <b>entire class card needed to be clickable</b> instead of just the “read more” link and the
                    description,
                    since many users did not know where to click to view the page.</li>
                <li>The <b>password requirements for the text could be bigger</b>; some users immediately began typing
                    without
                    reading them.</li>
                <li>The <b>star icon for the favorites page</b> in the navbar may be ambiguous since one user did not
                    click it when
                    trying to find the favorites page.</li>
                <li>Many users liked the layout of the page. They said it was <b>not too complicated and that it felt
                        similar to other applications</b> they’ve used.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We made changes to our prototype design according to these findings, as shown below.</p>

            <small>Retrospective</small>

            <h2>What did we learn?</h2>
            <p>✽ The value of contextual inquiries was definitely strengthened for us; going into this project, we
                expected users to be interested in having the ability to communicate with instructors outside of class,
                but we found the opposite to be true.</p>
            <p>✽ There were four of us working on this project, and we realised after completing our interviews that
                using data-capturing tools like Airtable would have simplified our data consolidation process.</p>

            <h2>What's next?</h2>
            <p>✽ We would love to create a high-fidelity version of this project that is fully built outside of these
                two specific user flows.</p>
