        <!-- SECTION 1 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Problem Space Exploration</small>

            <h2>Buying merchandise at a concert venue takes a lot of time and energy, with no equal alternative.</h2>

            <p>Buying merch at concerts can be a painstaking experience. You want the exclusive products, but do you go
                when you get there, so you get first pick and things don't sell out? Do you take a break in the middle
                of the show and miss part of the set? Or do you go at the end when you're exhausted and wait in a super
                long line?</p>

            <p>None of those sound like great options, so I designed a concert merch app for a (fictional) rap group,
                K$, allowing fans to pre-order merch for pickup and view product availability in advance. My goal is to
                streamline the concert experience:</p>

            <h3>Maximise time spent at the show, and minimise time spent in long lines.</h3>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Understanding the user: Personas</small>

            <h2>Who is this for?</h2>

            <p>I conducted interviews in order to better understand what the target group for this product most needs
                and how to best start designing for that. The primary user group identified through my research was
                young adults (18-24) who are avid concert-goers and want a simplified merch-buying process to support
                their favourite artists.</p>

            <p>The surveyed user group confirmed initial assumptions about the types of customers this app would mainly
                service, but also revealed another user group that includes families with kids. For both groups,
                research revealed the current lack of digital pre-ordering options lengthens the purchasing process.</p>

            <h3>Primary pain points: Time & Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Users want to get through the process as efficiently as possible. However, there is no way to view all
                available items until the front of the line, and products are targeted to those with existing
                familiarity.</p>

            <div class="row">

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Understanding the market: Competitive Audit</small>

            <h2>Is anyone else doing this?</h2>

            <p>As a merchandising app, some of the necessary competitors to analyse included eBay and Redbubble.
                None were direct competitors, but were still in the same market of selling musicians' merchandise.</p>

            <p>The overarching trend was that these apps generally catered to a vast user group, and as
                such, their products are often not divided into specific or easily navigable categories.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 4 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Wireframing and Lo-Fi Prototypes</small>

            <h2>Developing a design</h2>

            <p>A simple and straightforward process was a key user need to address in the designs. I decided to keep the
                home screen simple to save users time spent on navigation; each app page prioritises the upcoming
                shows and available products. </p>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Usability testing</small>

            <h2>Does this tackle user pain points sufficiently?</h2>

            <p>Following lo-fi prototyping, I created a usability study with 12 questions and tasks for participants to
                complete. A quick affinity diagram revealed these findings:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>✽ Users want the <b>selected show to be visible</b> throughout the flow.</li>
                <li>✽ Users want a <b>more intuitive checkout process.</b></li>
            </ul>

        <!-- SECTION 6 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Style Guide</small>

            <h2>Creating the visual moodboard</h2>

            <p>K$'s dark and muted colour scheme was developed with the image of being at a concert in mind–you could sneak the
                app open in the dark and no one would know! The yellow accent colour is intended to make the app feel a
                little warmer and more inviting.</p>

            <small>Hi-Fi Prototype</small>

            <h2>Iterating the design</h2>

            <p>After creating a mid-fi prototype, I conducted a second usability test before this final iteration.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm mb-5 align-self-center">

        <!-- SECTION 7 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Retrospective</small>

            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

            <p>✽ As someone who loves going to concerts and collecting tour merch, this was an exciting project to work
                on. This was my first time going through the full process from ideation, to testing & research, to
                designing, and it was definitely an incredibly useful skill set to develop</p>

            <p>✽ The emphasis on user research also helped me learn to really focus on keeping the user at the
                forefront of my work (as is the point of UX design, but with personal projects, it's easy to get lost in
                your own ideas), and it's something I know will help me in future work.</p>

            <h2>What's next?</h2>

            <p>✽ Conducting more usability testing would be helpful to ensure all pain points have been addressed and
                there are no new user needs.</p>
            <p>✽ I also think it would be interesting to try to adapt it for venues or labels instead of specific
                artists' shows!</p>
