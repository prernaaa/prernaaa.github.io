            <h2>A little about the project</h2>

            <p>For HCI 445 at DePaul, my team–myself and three others–conducted research to better understand users'
                experiences with digital clutter, and formulate design implications accordingly. While there are no
                tangible artifacts for this project, feel free to read our findings report below if you're interested!

        <div class="studysection">
            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

            <p>Digital clutter and digital hoarding have been shown to decrease mental health. However, current research
                focuses on general digital clutter, and solutions exist to fix the issue instead of preventing it. Our
                research focuses on social media and looks at the motivations and circumstances around why people save
                content, and how they interact with it. Digital clutter deeply affects usability and accessibility, and
                as a result, is a necessary topic to explore.</p>

            <p>We started with an observational study with eight participants recruited through DePaul’s CDM Participant
                Pool. All participants were 18 years or older and willing to screen share their Pinterest, TikTok, or
                Instagram applications. We gave scenario-based tasks to participants to gather two main insights: how
                digital clutter builds up on social media, and how users engage with it.</p>

            <p>We then interviewed eight participants, also recruited through the Participant Pool. All participants
                were 18 years or older and active social media users. We inquired about their behaviors and motivations
                for organizing, saving, retrieving, and trying content.</p>

            <p>We created affinity diagrams and categorized our findings and insights into the following main themes:
            </p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>Saving is social.</li>
                <li>Convenience is a priority.</li>
                <li>Content type affects retrieval behavior.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We found that saving is social for all users. Many users save with the intent to share content with
                others later. Additionally, some users also send content as a way of saving, which provides them with an
                additional location to consider during retrieval. Given this, our solutions, such as a search feature,
                must account for content that is saved in messages as well as folders.</p>

            <p>Convenience is highly valued by all users, but manifests in different ways for different user types,
                regardless of their degree of organization. Participants with high-effort organization systems
                prioritize easy retrieval, while those with low-effort or no organization systems prioritize immediate
                convenience. We suggest AI-driven folder systems or chronological filters for low-effort users, and a
                tagging feature to aid high-effort systems. A search feature and deleting duplicate saved content were
                highly preferred by both user groups.</p>

            <p>We also found that content type affects users’ retrieval behavior. Users save three types of content:
                promotional (e.g. products, events, and restaurants), tutorial (e.g. recipes, DIYs), and inspirational
                (e.g. ideas for design, home decor, etc., as well as content they like). We found that users engage with
                saved content differently, in terms of frequency and length, based on the intent of retrieval and
                content type. Intent can be passive or active: users with passive intent tend to retrieve inspirational
                content, while users with active intent retrieve promotional or tutorial content. Promotional content
                prompted longer and more engaging digital interactions from users compared to other content types. Our
                recommendation is to introduce a nudge system to motivate users to act upon their promotional saved
                items. Additionally, an indicator on the content equipping users with relevant information (e.g. the
                duration of an activity or reviews for a location) can provide an additional push for users to try
                content. We also recommend a highlight reel for inspirational saved content. This would help resurface
                buried content and bring up positive emotions for users.</p>

            <p>For our next steps, we will prototype solutions from the priority matrix and evaluate them with users to
                determine the efficacy of these solutions in mitigating digital clutter.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Through advancements in technology, users can create and collect digital content, such as videos or
                files, more efficiently than ever. As a result, the volume of digital content in an individual’s digital
                collection continues to increase and users are now faced with digital clutter. Unlike physical clutter
                that might exist in a few physical spaces, digital clutter spans multiple personal tech devices,
                websites, and even social platforms (Uğur & Caliskan, 2022; Zhao et al., 2013). For example, a user
                might have pictures on their phone and computer, in iCloud and Google drive, and multiple social
                platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Digital spaces are more flexible and have less spatial
                limitations than physical spaces, thanks to technology like cloud storage (Sweeten et al., 2018). Thus,
                users are more likely to build up digital clutter as compared to physical clutter. </p>

            <p>Digital clutter and digital hoarding have been shown to decrease mental health and well-being, so it is
                important to explore how to mitigate it (Sweeten et al., 2018; Neave et al., 2020). Digital clutter is a
                human-computer interaction issue at its core because it affects usability and impacts the cognitive load
                of using interfaces. Additionally, mitigating digital clutter can enhance accessibility by ensuring
                organized and clean digital spaces for everyone.</p>

            <p>Our study adds to the current conversation of digital clutter by exploring how it builds up on
                individuals’ social media and users’ current mitigation strategies. Current research mostly focuses on
                digital clutter as a whole but does not look at specific digital spaces, like social media. We hope to
                bridge this gap with our research. Additionally, existing products to deal with digital clutter, such as
                Unroll.me for email, focus on responding to digital clutter that has already built up. We believe a
                holistic approach to look at how and why digital clutter accumulates is needed. Our study seeks to
                understand the motivations and circumstances behind saving content on social media. Specifically, we
                look at users’ saving behaviors and how they interact with saved content. Through our research, we hope
                to identify design implications to mitigate digital clutter on social media platforms that could
                ultimately improve mental health.</p>

        <div class="studysection">
            <h2>Methods</h2>

            <h3>Observation.</h3>

            <h4>Participants</h4>
            <p>We recruited eight participants through the CDM Participant Pool. All participants were active users of
                social media, 18 years or older, and willing to share their mobile screens. Seven of the eight
                participants were female, and one was male. We informed participants that their screens, which displayed
                either TikTok, Pinterest, or Instagram, would be recorded for observational purposes. Six participants
                shared their Instagram content, one shared Pinterest, and one shared TikTok.</p>

            <h4>Data Collection</h4>
            <p>We met participants remotely via Zoom and asked them to review and sign a consent form before the study.
                We then introduced the project and gained further verbal consent from the participants.</p>
            <p>We presented participants with two scenario-based tasks, and asked several follow-up questions. For the
                first task, we were interested in observing how content clutter might build up. For the second, we
                wanted to observe how they interacted with this saved content. To reduce potential bias, we let
                participants perform tasks uninterrupted and only spoke when necessary. Finally, we asked follow-up
                questions to assess their feelings and thoughts on the study. We went back to the study recordings to
                take notes and ensure we recorded accurate data.</p>

            <h4>Analysis Methods</h4>
            <p>To learn more about the participants' behaviors, we applied the AEIOU (Activities, Environment,
                Interactions, Objects, and Users) framework. The team applied open coding to conduct a qualitative
                analysis, and used FigJam to create an affinity diagram using our notes.</p>

            <h3>Interview.</h3>

            <h4>Participants</h4>
            <p>We recruited eight participants from the CDM Participant Pool. All participants were adults and active
                social media users. Their ages ranged from 23 to 38, with five females and three males. Most
                participants were master's students, with three also working.</p>

            <h4>Data Collection</h4>
            <p>All interviews were conducted remotely via Zoom. Before conducting the interview, we obtained
                participants’ consent and inquired about their preferred social media platforms. The interview was
                divided into six sections of deep-focus open-ended questions.</p>
            <p>We first focused on users' behaviors and motivations for saving, organizing, retrieving, and trying
                content. Next, we explored the connection between social media, organization, and mental health.
                Finally, we inquired about users’ awareness of and preferences for technologies to help mitigate digital
                clutter, and their perspectives on our proposed design solutions. We also collected demographic
                information before concluding the session.</p>

            <h4>Analysis Methods</h4>
            <p>We independently coded our interview transcripts using Atlas.ti and developed a codebook outlining the
                themes that emerged from our interviews. We used Mural to collaborate on an affinity diagram that
                revealed our main findings. This data informed our persona spectrums, personas, scenarios, journey maps,
                and priority matrix.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <h2>Findings</h2>

            <p>We summarized our findings from the observations and interviews into four categories using an affinity
                diagram:</p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>Behaviors
                    <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>Saving content</li>
                        <li>Organizing content</li>
                        <li>Revisiting content</li>
                        <li>Content type and interactions</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Motivations for saving and organizing
                    <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>Content retrieval</li>
                        <li>Sharing</li>
                        <li>Curating the social media experience</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Emotions and roadblocks
                    <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>Content retrieval</li>
                        <li>Trying content</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Users want personalization and ease of use</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Behaviors.</h3>

            <h4>Saving Content</h4>
            <p>All participants saved content to folders on social media applications. Most had personalized
                organization systems. For example, one interviewee interested in soccer, cooking, and movies had one
                folder for each category. Participants with such organization systems only saved new content to
                contextually-relevant folders; if a piece of content did not fit in their existing folders, they created
                a new folder for it.</p>
            <p>All participants also had a catch-all folder, which one participant likened to a junk drawer. Examples of
                this for social media include the default “all posts” folder on Instagram, the “likes” tab on TikTok,
                and personally-created catch-all folders. Users who had personalized organization systems used their
                catch-all less frequently.</p>
            <p>Finally, some participants utilized additional methods, such as saving to collaborative folders,
                downloading content to their devices, screenshotting content, and sending content to friends.</p>

            <h4>Organizing Content</h4>
            <p>Three interviewees unsaved or deleted content as a way of organizing their folders, while five moved
                content to new folders. However, none set aside time specifically to organize; participants did so when
                they came across content during retrieval that they noticed was misplaced or no longer interesting to
                them.</p>

            <h4>Revisiting Content</h4>
            <p>Most participants’ process of retrieval was trying to remember when they saved it, followed by “a lot of
                scrolling” through their folders or messages.</p>
            <p>After retrieving content, almost all participants viewed the post, comments, or captions again, or sent
                it to their friends. Only three mentioned taking additional actions on posts, including taking a
                screenshot, visiting the poster’s profile, or clicking an external link.</p>

            <h4>Content Type and Interactions</h4>
            <p>We noted three primary categories of content saved or retrieved by users: promotional, tutorial, and
                inspirational. Promotional content includes products, events, and restaurants; tutorials include recipes
                and other DIYs; and inspirational content includes general ideas for design, home decor, etc., or
                content that the user simply enjoys.</p>
            <p>During the observation, promotional content prompted most actions, with participants clicking on links
                associated with these posts. Some participants opened external applications to continue browsing about
                the topic. For example, one user found a restaurant they had saved a video about, and looked up reviews
                and directions. As such, interactions with promotional content were longer. While interviewees had
                relatively less digital interaction with tutorial content, they noted that it prompted further real-life
                action from them.</p>
            <p>Inspirational content had less frequent and shorter interactions overall. Participants typically viewed
                these posts without further engagement.</p>

            <h3>Motivations for saving and organizing.</h3>

            <h4>Content Retrieval</h4>
            <p>All participants stated that they saved content they aimed to revisit for varying reasons, and saving
                would allow them to find it more easily.</p>

            <h4>Sharing</h4>
            <p>All participants noted a social aspect to their saving habits. Five interviewees stated they saved
                content to share with friends later, and some sent content to their friends as a way of saving.</p>

            <h4>Curating the Social Media Experience</h4>
            <p>Most participants viewed saving and curating as valuable to their social media experience. Organizing
                saved content helps participants parse through general social media content and control their digital
                spaces. Half of the participants identified a nostalgic aspect of revisiting content, with one referring
                to their social media folders as a “personal archive."</p>

            <h3>Emotions and roadblocks.</h3>

            <h4>Content Retrieval</h4>
            <p>Regardless of their level of organization, all participants found revisiting older saved content
                challenging. One participant stated the following about their folders: “Sometimes it's hard to remember
                what all I have in there. Some things just get lost essentially.”</p>
            <p>Unsuccessful content retrieval attempts were identified as the primary reason for negative emotions in
                participants. Three participants also felt guilty or burdened with the amount of content they had saved.
                Relatedly, most participants associated organization with positive emotions.</p>

            <h4>Trying Content</h4>
            <p>Almost all participants noted feelings of satisfaction, motivation, or accomplishment after successfully
                trying saved content. The main roadblock preventing users from trying content was the perceived time or
                effort required to do the activity. However, half of the participants noted that “it’s just social
                media,” and felt no negative emotions towards the amount of saved content they had not tried.</p>

            <h3>Users want personalization and ease of use.</h3>

            <p>When asked about each of our design recommendations, all participants mentioned that they prioritize
                personalization and accuracy in any solution. Searchability was the most important feature for all
                participants, and was brought up as the ideal solution for two participants before we asked about it.

            <h2>Discussion</h2>

            <p>Our goal for this study was to contribute to existing literature about digital clutter. We explored its
                presence on social media, considered the motivations and behaviors behind it, and examined its potential
                effects on mental health.</p>

            <p>Based on our findings, our team identified five key insights:</p>

            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>Users save for retrieval</li>
                <li>Saving has a social aspect</li>
                <li>Convenience is a priority for all users</li>
                <li>Convenience optimization varies by user type while saving
                    <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>High-effort organizational systems</li>
                        <li>Low-effort organizational systems</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Content type affects behavior
                    <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>Active intent</li>
                        <li>Passive intent</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Users save for retrieval.</h3>

            <p>
                All of our participants verbalized that they save content intending to reference it later – including
                those who save to share later, as they must also retrieve it before sharing. Participants with
                high-effort organizational systems could access their saved content more easily. It is important to
                highlight this relationship between organization and retrieval. The introduction of a search feature can
                potentially simplify users’ ability to retrieve saved content.
            </p>

            <h3>Saving has a social aspect.</h3>

            <p>The majority of participants mentioned that they save content to send to others later. Some users also
                reported that they view sending content to friends as a way of saving instead of using folders. These
                participants relied on remembering who they sent specific content to for retrieval. Given the social
                aspect of saving, solutions aiming to mitigate digital clutter, such as a search feature, must account
                for content that is saved in messages, in addition to users’ saved folders.</p>

            <h3>Convenience is a priority.</h3>

            <p>Our participants consistently prioritized convenience, regardless of their degree of organization.
                Participants with high-effort organization systems, such as distinct categorical folders, achieved
                long-term convenience by using those systems to maintain organization and easy retrieval. Alternatively,
                users with low-effort or no organization systems received immediate convenience by saving content
                without organizing it. Adding an AI-driven organizational system has the potential to simplify the
                content organization process, increasing convenience for users. Another recommendation that can improve
                convenience is deleting duplicate saved content.</p>

            <h3>Convenience optimization varies by user type while saving.</h3>

            <p>Our participants used one of two organization systems: high-effort organization by creating folders and
                organizing while saving, and low-effort organization by saving content into a single catch-all folder.
                These behaviors highlight the different approaches our participants took to achieve convenience.</p>
            <p>All users relied on chronology to parse through saved content. Additionally, unsuccessful content
                retrieval attempts (e.g. with older saved content) were the primary cause for negative emotions. As
                such, we recommend the ability to filter by date so that users can easily reference content based on
                when they remember saving it.</p>

            <h4>High-effort organizational systems</h4>
            <p>Users with high-effort organizational systems prioritized long-term convenience, striving to make the
                process of retrieving saved content easier by exerting more effort during the saving process. The
                introduction of a tagging feature has the potential to help these users effectively manage their saved
                digital clutter. Additionally, by tagging content during the saving process, users could later search
                these up during retrieval, quickly accessing the content. Easy and successful content retrieval
                encourages users to engage with or organize their saved content.</p>

            <h4>Low-effort organizational systems</h4>
            <p>Users with low-effort organizational systems prioritized short-term convenience, making the saving
                process as passive as possible. As a result, during retrieval, some participants ended up feeling
                overwhelmed by the amount of content they had saved. The introduction of AI-driven suggested folders
                would allow for immediate convenience by removing the need for them to manually create folders, while
                improving organization. This would facilitate easy retrieval and organization in the future.</p>

            <h3>Content type affects behavior.</h3>

            <p>Participants engaged with saved content differently, in terms of frequency and length, depending on
                whether the content was promotional, tutorial, or inspirational. Despite varied engagement, almost all
                users associated trying content with positive feelings. Introducing a technology-based nudge system has
                the potential to motivate users to act on their saved promotional or tutorial items, such as by visiting
                a saved restaurant or cooking a saved recipe. After completing the action, the system could prompt users
                to unsave the post, reducing the buildup of saved content. Furthermore, an indicator on the content with
                relevant information (e.g. the duration of an activity, or reviews for a location) can provide an
                additional push for users to do the activity.</p>

            <h4>Active intent</h4>
            <p>Participants who retrieved saved content with a goal actively engaged with the content; they either
                shared it, interacted with the post, or took real-life action. This type of content was typically
                promotional or tutorial.</p>

            <h4>Passive intent</h4>
            <p>Participants who lacked a goal for retrieving saved content engaged with it passively, without taking any
                actions. This content was often inspirational. Users also noted feeling nostalgic when looking at older
                saved content they enjoyed. Based on this, we recommend adding a highlight reel to resurface older,
                buried content.</p>

            <h3>Limitations.</h3>

            <p>Although our research offers valuable insights, it is important to address its limitations. In our study,
                participants were able to share from either Instagram, Pinterest, or TikTok. However, there was an
                unequal distribution of users across these platforms with the majority favoring Instagram and fewer
                selecting TikTok or Pinterest. Each of these social media platforms provides different ways for users to
                browse, save, and revisit content. Given our uneven distribution of participants across platforms, we
                recognize that our data is primarily influenced by user experiences with Instagram and thus may not
                accurately reflect user behaviors, attitudes, and experiences across all major social media platforms.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, we recruited through the DePaul CDM participant pool, limiting our demographics in terms of
                age and education. This may not accurately reflect the diverse profiles of many social media users who
                struggle with digital clutter. Therefore, our findings may have low external validity, making them less
                generalizable to broader populations.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 6 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>

            <p>Moving forward, we plan to conduct additional interviews to further explore digital clutter on social
                media, including the motivations and behaviors behind it. It would be beneficial to test a larger sample
                size of participants with experiences across a wider range of social media platforms. Through these
                interviews, we hope to discover insights that can inform further implications for design. Furthermore,
                we aim to conduct usability tests to evaluate the effectiveness of our current design recommendations in
                mitigating saved content clutter on social media.</p>
