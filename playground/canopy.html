        <!-- SECTION 1 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Overview</small>

            <h2>A little about the project</h2>

            <p>For my final project in the Pratt Institute Graphic Design Intensive, I worked on rebranding the Canopy
                Club, a local events venue in the Champaign-Urbana area. Canopy Club is at the edge of Urbana, while
                most of its competitors are closer to the heart of the Univeristy of Illinois campus, almost a mile away
                in Champaign. The primary function of the venue is for live events, but it's also a pub that hosts game
                nights and other events, and serves food from neighbouring restaurants. However, it doesn't advertise
                the latter opportunities as much as it can, and generally doesn't draw the attention of those who aren't
                concert-goers</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Initial Research</small>

            <h2>The neighbourhood</h2>

            <p>The Canopy Club is tucked away in an alley past an Urbana sidewalk as part of an older construction. As
                such, little can be done to the building itself, but I did see opportunities for improvement along the
                streetside with the marquee board and other signage. Though not pictured here, I also thought the
                courtyard area could some redecorating; taking pictures at bars and concerts is incredibly common, and
                the Canopy currently does not have any unique areas for photographs like its local competitors do.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Inspiration</small>

            <h2>What's the goal for the rebranding?</h2>

            <p>I took to the neon aesthetic of clubs as inspiration for modernising the Canopy. I couldn't physically
                redesign the interior of the venue, but if I could, this is what I would want it to look like!</p>

        <div class="studysection">
            <small>Ideation and Process</small>

            <h2>Adapting the inspiration to the brand</h2>

            <p>My goal for the new identity of the Canopy Club was a more mature aesthetic, while still being fun and
                colourful–inspired by the images above. The intent of the muted colours to achieve the former, and the
                variety of colours, arched logo, and footer accent font of Playfair sought to do the latter. I also
                tested out a few different logo options before settling on the current red arc with text inside!</p>

            <h2>Oh, I love that place!</h2>

            <p>I also redesigned the marquee board and courtyard, and created an A-frame stand using Illustrator and
                Photoshop! These were some of my first experiences with these tools, so the execution isn't as crisp as
                I'd like, but the sentiment is there :)</p>

            <h2>What did I learn, and what's next?</h2>

            <p>✽ I didn't have much prior experience using these tools, so this definitely helped me establish a solid
                foundation. I plan on recreating these in the future to see how I can improve and expand upon these
                designs and ideas! Especially the website, considering my knowledge of UX now.</p>
